Practice Challenge!

## Process:


1. Keep Practicing what was previously learned
 
 - Solidify Css and Sass with more projects, i was learning to use breaks points flex bos, and a lot more stuff so practice would only do me good, i did struggle with this one I remember, i coulf not figure out how to shift one to right right and the other to the left. looking back it was pretty simple but hey, i was learning and it-s all good
